# Spell Checking?

If you are looking for spell checking we recommend [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) as they both provide browser extensions for spelling and grammar checking.

# Update times and release

When the developer of the extension think that a new release is ready and tested they create a new release and publish on Firefox and Chrome addons store.  
After that step we have to wait few hours for Chrome and for Firefox and all the installations will be updated automatically.
